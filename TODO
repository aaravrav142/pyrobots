== TODO pyrobots before release 1.0 ==

- dynamic OTP
- fix 'put' to work without previous 'pick'
- 'go to the home' should work
- profile execution to improve reaction time
- improve placement for manipulation (integration of Jim code to find a place and to move to it with full-body motion)
- fix word repetition in "dialogs | say"
- improve tracking + motion (maybe remove tracking and simply look forward)
- switch between narrow and wide cameras is too slow
